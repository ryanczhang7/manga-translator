#                   diff could not be computed, or `lib.sh` could not be loaded

#
# Step 2 of GATES -> REVIEW asks this before spending minutes (hours on a busy
# Windows host) on `SELFTEST_JOBS=4 bash scripts/selftest.sh`. The harness
# suites read harness paths - scripts, `.claude/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, the workflows
# - so a story that changes none of them cannot break one, and CI's own run on
# the PR is the backstop either way (HARNESS-075).
#
# "The story's diff" is the same enumeration as the `covers` check in
# `gates.sh`: base = first of origin/main, main that resolves; changes against
# `git merge-base <base> HEAD`, committed or not, plus untracked files. It is
# duplicated rather than shared because `sigpipe.test.sh` pins `gates.sh` line
# numbers. Deliberate differences: with no merge base, `gates.sh` falls back
# to the base itself, and this answers `run`; a failing `git diff` or
# `git ls-files` answers `run` rather than an empty set; a rename counts under
# both names (`--no-renames`). Both scripts read NUL-separated output (`-z`),
# so no name is C-quoted: not a non-ASCII one, and not `"`, `\` or a tab
# (HARNESS-078). `lib.sh` is probe-loaded in a subshell first, so a
# library that will not load answers `run` and its error reaches stderr, and a
# missing `paths.conf` or a failing classify step answers `run` too (HARNESS-077).
# Known limit: a name holding a newline still splits into two paths that name
# no file, and is misread.
#
# --- `--suites [base-ref]`: WHICH suites (HARNESS-094) ------------------------
#
#   bash scripts/selftest-needed.sh --suites [base-ref]
#
#   stdout  the names of the suites in .claude/tests/*.test.sh that the changed
#           harness paths can break, sorted, one per line; or the one line
#           `all`; or nothing
#   exit 0  a list, or `all` - including every fallback above, which in this
#           mode answers `all`
#   exit 1  no harness path changed (stdout empty, the skip line on stderr)
#   exit 2  usage
#   stderr  a header, then one line per selected suite: the first path, in sort
#           order, that selected it, and the rule
#
# The same enumeration as the run/skip mode. Then, for each harness path, every
# rule that matches contributes, and `all` wins over everything:
#   R1 itself    .claude/tests/<name>.test.sh selects <name>
#   R2 every     .claude/tests/_lib.sh, .claude/tests/_spawns.sh,
#                scripts/selftest.sh and .claude/hooks/lib.sh are read by
#                every suite: `all` (A-4)
#   R3 mentioned a suite whose source holds the path as a fixed substring
#                that ends where the path ends; comments and test data
#                count, so a path a suite names only as test data is
#                mapped by that mention and never reaches R5 (HARNESS-096)
#   R4 scans     a row of the SCANS table below; an `add` row adds its suite
#                but does not map the path (A-5)
#   R5 unmapped  a path R1-R3 and R4's `map` rows all miss: `all`, naming the
#                path. A path the mapping cannot place selects more, never
#                fewer.
# A rule names a suite only when its .claude/tests/<name>.test.sh exists in
# this tree (amendment A-1), so a deleted suite, or a row whose suite is
# absent, contributes nothing - and a path left with no existing suite is R5's.
#
# Known limit: a suite that exercises a changed script only through another
# script, and never names it, is not selected. Transitive selection was
# measured and rejected (one level from gates.sh selects nearly every suite);
# CI's full run is the backstop.
